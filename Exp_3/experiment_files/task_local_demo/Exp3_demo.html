    <p>The two medicines differ in their average efficacy:</p>
   
    <p>On average, the probability with which an early treatment with Alcetyne® prevents death from Lipogastrosis is 65%. 
    That means: Out of one hundred infected people who receive an early treatment with Alcetyne®, sixty-five will be rescued and thirty-five will still die from the disease, 
    on average.</p>
    
    <p>On average, the probability with which an early treatment with Zyphranol® prevents death from Lipogastrosis is 90%. 
    That means: Out of one hundred infected people who receive an early treatment with Zyphranol®, ninety will be rescued and ten will still die from the disease, 
    on average.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to this difference in the medicines’ average efficacy, there is another difference:</p>
    
    <p>The 90% average probability with which an early treatment with Zyphranol® prevents death from Lipogastrosis varies across patients depending on a patient’s type 
    of blood composition. That means that the probability of survival due to a treatment with Zyphranol® will be much lower than 90% for some patients and much 
    higher than 90% for other patients.</p>
