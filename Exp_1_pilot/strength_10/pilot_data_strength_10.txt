532	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	86	31	1	1	23	1	Given that blood compositions are evenly distributed in the population, Alcetryne has a high efficacy rate on only four of the blood compositions and close to 0% efficacy on the other blood compositions. Given that blood compositions are evenly distributed in the population, this medicine would be ineffective at preventing death through early treatment.	6	2	-99	670	incorrect

537	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	73	69	1	1	23	1	Every little helps. For example, doing push ups, jogging, going for a run and all other sorts of physical activities can help contribute to a more healthier lifestyle. With medicine A, it at least helps to provide some sort of impact to patients, regardless of their blood composition.    Medicine Z on the other hand only has major impacts for certain blood compositions. Ordering medicine Z would only be worthwhile for those able to be treated.	6	1	-99	299	correct
539	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	78	34	1	1	22	3	Well ideally, they'd be able to order both. Either way too many people are going to die, so I thought to go for the one that's relatively stable and doesn't have dramatic spikes occasionally and is almost ineffective most of the rest of the time.	6	1	No errors :)	227	correct
541	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	91	4	1	1	25	1	I would rather go with the option that has a fixed percentage of 10%. Patients will have an equal probability of living.	6	1	-99	438	correct
543	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	57	1	1	18	1	although zyphranol has a higher chance to treat the illness in some cases it also has a higher chance to fail where as Alcetyne has a consistent 10% in treating the illness and i believe that it is up to the patient to decide on the one that has a higher success rate and failure rate or the one that is consistent but still has a high chance to fail	6	1	-99	468	correct
546	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	13	1	1	27	1	The risk of losing more patients is not as high as with one medicine as its effectiveness isn't solely based on blood composition like the second medicine.	6	1	-99	530	correct
547	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	86	43	1	1	37	1	one drug gives an even chance to all but if blood type is known the other drug could be more effective in some cases	6	1	-99	227	correct
552	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	28	77	1	1	22	2	10% is a low success rate for treatment, so I did not think it worthwhile to chose the drug that uniformly offers that probability of curing the disease, across all people. It is not a very hopeful perspective. In contrast, the other drug looked very promising for a considerable amount of people and it is worth giving them a stronger chance.	6	1	-99	246	correct
553	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	84	65	1	1	31	1	Because Alcetyne is more stable and consistent whereas Zyphranol is very varied depending on the blood etc. much more unpredictable	6	1	-99	162	correct
555	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	37	76	1	1	45	1	It looks like from the graph Zyphronal could be more effective to help	6	3	-99	393	incorrect
559	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	80	45	1	1	20	2	The medicine that only affects a certain percentage of the population with a specific blood type is not inclusive, therefore the government should order the medicine that allows all people the equal chance of treatment despite blood composition	6	1	N/A	309	correct
560	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	13	1	1	27	2	Although the chances are the same for n=both these medicines. The Z has a lesser than 10% chance to save people with a certain blood type and its different with A.	4	3	-99	1602	incorrect
561	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	67	20	1	1	26	2	Because the overall percentage for the second drug was higher than the first one. The first drug averaged at 10% only due to the fact that there were random spikes of probability from few blood types, but if you were to look at the chart as a whole this drug was less than 10% effective on a larger percentage of people then the second. The second drug is more effective for more for a larger number of people.	6	1	-99	546	correct
562	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	78	32	1	1	50	2	The chances of saving more people is more consistent with the second drug. The first drug, Z, will save only more with a certain blood composition, but not more people in general.	6	1	-99	319	correct
564	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	31	84	1	1	29	1	I believe that the government should order Zyphranol because of how significantly higher the chances of survival are for people who have specific blood compositions, of which, according to the graph, were fairly abundant with a survival rate of over 75%. I think that this outweighs the low chance of survival that both drugs offer (10%), and that ultimately Zyphranol would save more lives overall.	6	1	-99	418	correct
567	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	92	10	1	1	29	2	It seems morally fair to give everyone in society an equal shot at overcoming the disease, however in an ideal world, both would be available, and those with compatible blood compositions would take Zyphanol	6	1	n/a	264	correct
568	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	100	1	1	22	2	I don't see why both medications shouldn't be ordered. Either they can be used in tandem or tests can be done to determine the right drug for the patient. If there is a case where this couldn't be done then the drug with the more consistent outcome should be chosen.	6	1	-99	310	correct
573	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	71	30	1	1	31	2	I'm not confident in my decision, but feel that the medication that offers a 10% chance of survival regardless of blood composition provides a better chance for the majority of people in the country.	6	1	-99	438	correct
574	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	93	66	1	1	47	1	The drug beginning with A gets around the spike points and therefore the rollout can be managed and results catered and planned for more readily. The other drug beginning with Z is more effective, but will need greater resource to manage the spikes, which are unpredictable.	3	1	-99	338	incorrect
575	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	49	49	1	1	67	1	This information and exercise is way above my pay grade (if I worked) and can only be decided by people who may have studied the situation and know how these sort of things work, I am sorry I do not	6	3	-99	297	incorrect
577	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	74	44	1	1	29	2	I think the government should order the first drug in the line graph that is red because it is more consistent in helping people than the other option	6	3	-99	255	incorrect
579	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	74	48	1	1	62	2	It seems that it works properly for only a few and has a much lower success rate for the majority. Alcetyne seems more conistently likely to work (or not)	6	1	None	393	correct
585	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	51	65	1	1	33	2	I have stated those ratings, because there needs to be fairness in how people are treated with the disease and medicines	3	1	-99	975	incorrect
587	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	63	43	1	1	35	2	Ultimately, both of the drugs will deliver a 10% survival rate, however A drug ( apologies, I can't remember the exact name) gives an even distribution of survival across the board. Although Z drug could, in some blood types, offer a survival rate as high as 75%, in others it's almost 0% - this could have further ramifications down the line. For instance if O negative blood types were to be the 0% survival rate, that could cause further serious problems to emegency blood supplies for other emergencies and issues. It would be better to have an even amount of survival across the board.	6	1	-99	617	correct
588	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	85	41	1	1	27	2	I believe that it is better to choose the medication that does not depend on the blood type to be effective, as people with ineffective blood types will feel as if they are not considered on this treatment. It is better for all people to have hope in that 10% than to have a certain group that knows they are the only one guaranteed to survive on the medication.	6	1	None	656	correct
591	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	65	79	1	1	70	2	Alcetyne will give a reasonable response but the chance of more people surviving with zyphranol is much higher for certain blood groups.      There was a greater chance of survival for 20% of the blood groups with zyphranol.       In reality we really need more information about the spread of blood types thru the population	6	1	-99	643	correct
592	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	50	87	1	1	54	1	10% across all population blood types are saved, however with the one affected by blood type a larger proportion percentage are saved. it is the more effective treatment.	6	1	-99	645	correct
597	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	90	4	1	1	54	1	My reason is looking at the graph and deciding that the 10% that survive is better odds in having a sporadic survival rate that also gives less odds in surviving less than 10%	6	3	-99	694	incorrect
599	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	0	100	1	1	20	2	Although neither options are exactly great, the probability of death prevention was consistently low, whereas there were, at times very high death prevention rates on the medicine I chose. Although its not exactly fair surely it makes more sense to at least take the chance with the other medicine that just using the one that consistently gives low death prevention rates.	6	1	-99	409	correct
600	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	77	23	1	1	22	2	The blue line showed a more irrational and sporadic plot, whereas the red was more stable. This stability could be used in addition to other helpful medical decisions to save more lives, than randomly saving a few.	5	1	Medicine was spelled wrong on one of the pages.	187	incorrect
603	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	99	1	1	1	25	2	I think it's important to make decisions that will positively affect the majority. Ordering the medicine which can hugely benefit some and disadvantage others is too risky and puts peoples lives on a roulette.	4	1	I read the text fully but there was a lot of information and I could not remember the efficacy % of the medicines, as i concentrated more on the graph	262	incorrect
606	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	0	1	1	43	2	Alcetyne has a better overall success rate independant of blood composition therefore makes sense to use this drug.	6	1	-99	534	correct
608	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	67	52	1	1	49	2	It's a really tricky decision and I'm starting to doubt it even now. However, my thoughts are now that it's perhaps best to go with the drug which performs no differently according to blood type. Is this perhaps fairer? In an extreme pandemic, if the world population is affected massively, it would be risky to have only certain blood types prevalent in the world - keeping a balance of blood types surviving would be better for humanity?	6	1	-99	593	correct
611	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	17	84	1	1	44	2	Seems the virus will result in death for a lot of people either way but the one that depends on blood composition would possibly save more people overall	6	3	-99	247	incorrect
612	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	96	19	1	1	61	2	i think that on the whole the one i chose worked a lot better with early use	6	1	-99	425	correct
614	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	23	1	1	35	2	the results are more steady there no high peaks and very low drops. there rusults are stadty amd say the same id rather have this medician than take the risk on the other med	6	1	-99	412	correct
618	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	56	18	1	1	24	2	It would be better in society if everyone was to have an equal chance, rather than those born with certain characteristics having a higher chance than the rest.	6	1	-99	165	correct
622	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	47	41	1	1	36	1	The A drug is consistent across all types, this would mean no one group is placed above another.  However, it may be that more people survive on the Z group because in those groups it is much more affective.  I would want more information but given this would choose the one which saves the most lives overall.	6	1	-99	498	correct
623	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	13	80	1	1	58	2	I think it would be better to give more of the population a better chance of surviving than the 10% probability with the other drug.	6	1	-99	218	correct
625	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	85	11	1	1	45	1	I think the first one is too random in its effectiveness, and a government would want to have more of a surety that what they are doing its going to have guaranteed results.	6	1	Medicines is spelt incorrectly on one of the screens	187	correct
632	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	22	1	1	34	2	10% being saved doesn't provide the full story. In the event that the government doesn't have time (because of an outbreak) or capacity (too many people) to test or blood types, administering Alcetyne is the more responsible decision. If they have the patient's blood work from either previous tests or the time to gather the information now, it would be beneficial to administer Zyphranol to those patients. In this situation, however, it would still be best to administer the Alcetyne for other people. For these reasons, I absolutely think they need to order Alecytyne without question because it's the best chance for many people. I can understand the desire to order some Zyphranol when they have the possibility of doing the bloodwork or in those situations where bloodwork has already been done and it matches the higher percentages.	6	1	I didn't come across any errors	531	correct
633	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	93	9	1	1	57	2	Only 7 out of alot more than 14 blood types had a better than 10% chance of survival with zeph.... so. Within these 7 groups the survivalk chance was significantly more than 10% but for the remaining groups significantly less so to provide everyone with equal chance Apercol? should be used	6	1	no problems	430	correct
634	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	23	82	1	1	55	2	even though A is more consistent, I would order Z because it can be given specifically to those who have the blood composition that it works best for. Z can be more targeted and therefore get more or less the same results as A but for less outlay.	6	1	Just the spelling of the term 'medicines' The graph was very clear.	392	correct
637	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	96	3	1	1	50	1	I chose Alcetyne strongly because its impact is consistent across blood groups, 10% of people are consistently saved. This is very different from Zyphranol, which only benefits a small number of blood composition groups, albeit strongly. Choosing a group that only benefits a minority is hard to justify when compared with a treatment that has consistent effects.	6	1	Your survey worked fine, and the scenario was well set out.	507	correct
641	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	65	82	1	1	23	1	The Z drug has a lower probability to prevent death for some blood compositions and a very high one for certain blood compositions. Meanwhile, the A drug has a lower chance of prevention that is stable. The Z with its high probability for some blood compositions is a better choice for the government.	6	1	-99	242	correct
642	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	0	1	1	70	1	I just felt that the steady 10% option was better	6	1	-99	347	correct
643	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	82	20	1	1	40	1	The two are generally close together through the graph however the large inconsistent spikes of Zyphranol is the main reason why I decided against it	6	1	-99	906	correct
644	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	5	96	1	1	20	2	The Z medicine does have some chance of sucess, I accept that only 1 in 10 will survive but with the other medicine the survival rate is poor	6	1	None	215	correct
646	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	2	98	1	1	19	1	Zeph... was a more controlled substance, and it seemed like we understood exactly how it would react with different types of blood (realtively evenly). Because the government had to come up with a single remedy, it was a no brainer that it would be the one that prevented each blood types equally. It seemed to be the more stable substance.	6	2	-99	363	incorrect
647	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	84	37	1	1	39	2	The probability based on blood types is better for my chosen option. I feel like it has the same chance of success with a less chance of making a distinction negatively due to varying blood types.	6	1	non	149	correct
648	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	46	1	1	37	1	I think ordering the Alcetayne gives everybody a relatively equal shot at survival (10% ish regardless of bloos type). I didn't rule out ordering the other drug because it could give a much higher rate of survival to some people once we know their blood time.     But based on giving as much benefit to all people as possible I oped for the Alcetayne	6	1	-99	322	correct
651	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	48	57	1	1	30	1	It is very clear that one is above the other.	4	2	-99	152	incorrect
659	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	89	99	1	1	20	2	They should order both medicines and use the consistent one on people that the inconsistent one wouldnt work with. As in, give the one beginning with A to people who don't have the ideal blood types for the one beginning with Z (Can't remember how to spell them) and give the one beginning with Z to the people with ideal blood types	6	1	n/a	307	correct
660	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	52	25	1	1	33	1	10% is a very, very low number	6	1	-99	160	correct
661	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	72	42	1	1	21	2	I think the medicine that has a more consistent chance of helping is fairer. Also, I do not know how rare the certain types of blood composition are that are helped by the other drug so it seems more of a risk.	6	1	-99	272	correct
664	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	2	1	1	69	1	On average the Zynfanol medicine is less effective overall, meaning fewer people will survive.	6	1	Nothing major noted.  One spelling mistake - it is 'medicine'.	345	correct
666	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	34	87	1	1	27	2	the government should buy the Zyphrand because if ever the blood composition type of people is favorable we they would have a greater chance for instance it will be 20% or the chance of more people to surviving will be even higher. Unlike Alcetyne even if the blood type composition is  fair still chances of survival remains at 10%.	7	1	no error to be reported	1024	incorrect
667	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	74	53	1	1	21	1	Purchasing the drug which has a 10% chance across all patients is slightly more ethical as it gives all patients a chance at recovery. However, the drug which has a greater chance at causing certain types of patients to recover is also important, despite the increased variance.	6	1	-99	342	correct
668	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	53	97	1	1	24	2	I believe that Zyphranol is more efficient as opposed to Alcetyne, and this is because in respect of a large number of blood groups or blood types, its probability to prevent the disease is much high. On the other hand, Alcetyne 's efficiency is at a constant rate of 10% insofar as all blood groups are concerned.	6	1	-99	598	correct

687	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	91	5	1	1	36	2	The government is making a decision about how to use public funds. Therefore the decision should improve the chances for as many people as possible. In what is effectively a random lottery according to the description, giving everybody a ten percent chance of survival is better than giving a smaller number a much greater chance of survival. Though I realise that real life medicine may well have different thinking. Also, making it much more likely for people with particular blood types to survive means there might end up being an increase in the proportion of people with those blood types, which may have unintended negative consequences in the future.	6	1	None	919	correct

It gives some people a higher chance and lower chance based on blood, but people cannot choose what blood they have, so it's unfair to those who have blood which have a lower chance of being rescued.

Whereas using the A cure is known to be effective to a certain degree across the board and therefore I think it should be the method the government uses.	6	1	None	897	correct

719	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	63	71	1	1	53	1	Both need to be ordered because although one of them works very well for certain blood combinations for others it is ineffective. The second medication while not giving the highs of the first gives a steady amount of prevention. To be effective population wide both will be required.	4	1	-99	149	incorrect
720	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	93	7	1	1	54	1	Assuming that the government doesn't have a comprehensive database of the population's blood compositions, the blanket use of Zyphranol would be unethical given its negligible effect on a very large proportion of the population.

725	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	99	1	1	1	45	1	It appears that Alcetyne is more widely effective over a wider range of people/blood groups so I feel this is a more appropriate choice whereas the effectiveness of Zyphranol varies across patients depending on the type of blood composition.	6	1	No errors noticed.	581	correct
726	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	23	77	1	1	47	2	As the probability of each medicine curing the disease is so low, I think it would be better to give the people with the right blood composition the greater chance of being cured. It would make more sense to order both and just to prescribe Zyphranol to those who are in the right blood groups and Alcetyne to those who aren't. However, the choice is to order only one of the drugs and I think it makes more sense to improve the chances of those with the right blood groups as there is only a 10% chance of being cured otherwise for both drugs.	6	1	-99	391	correct
728	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	25	100	1	1	30	2	I'm going to refer to the drugs as 'A' and 'Z' as I cannot remember the spellings, so will use the first letter. Drug Z is the better choice as it gives a more consistent result and therefore is likely to save more people. Drug A is too much of a gamble if it affects different blood types differently, it will help less people.	6	2	-99	555	incorrect
732	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	77	27	1	1	26	2	I feel the government should buy the  Alcetyne® medicine as it has more chance of saving people than Zyphranol® . Though Zyphranol® has higher chance of survival in those with specific blood types , other have sometimes less than a 10% chance of survival so more people will die. With Alcetyne® , though it can only save 10% of people it does not depend on blood type and so can be used on anyone.	6	1	-99	-1	correct
733	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	99	1	1	1	46	1	With medicine Z it is even more of a lottery in terms of who will survive based on blood composition which no-one can control therefore the fairer thing would be to use medicine A as the results are much more standard and regular. Using Z would be like the winner of Russian Roulette having to play it again for a second time to see if they will survive but with A, everyone has a slightly fairer chance of survival.	6	1	Medicine was spelled incorrectly on the first information page.	650	correct
734	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	88	14	1	1	49	1	Despite each medication being equally effective, the medication A prevents more people from dying if they get early treatment. Medication Z has complications for treatment due to issues relating to blood composition.	6	3	-99	610	incorrect
736	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	1	1	1	68	1	I feel that a treatment with a guarantee of 10% is preferable..Either would be a bit of a lottery but there is at least some certainty with 1st vaccine.	6	1	-99	322	correct

743	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	76	14	1	1	30	1	I think that the medication that gives a more equal chance of helping people survive is more important to use, the other medication which has a higher probability of helping certain people is not really fair on those who cannot be helped by the medication. I chose the option that is more likely to help the most people.	6	1	n/a	584	correct
746	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	95	24	1	1	29	1	I can't remember the drugs' names exactly so I will call them A and Z. A is the one that works equally well on everyone. Z is the one that is only effective on certain blood compositions.    If we can only have a supply of one of these available, it makes more sense to me to have the one that can treat everyone who comes in to hospital. The Z drug can't save more people overall, but it does mean that a good fraction of the people seeking treatment may as well have not bothered, which is wasteful of other resources like staff time.    It would be good to get Drug A now to have a chance of saving each patient now, and later obtain some Drug Z to selectively use on the right patients to improve their individual chances.	6	1	mediciens  typo in the text	371	correct
747	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	21	57	1	1	44	2	I think that with Alcetyne the overall success rate is very low, for everyone, whereas with the other drug, although it is much more unequal between the blood types, as some blood types there is zero success, the success rates are very high with other blood types, and so I believe that overall there will be fewer deaths with this drug.	6	1	-99	396	correct
750	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	78	73	1	1	47	1	They are both 10% effective so in theory it won't matter which one they go for. I've opted for Alcetyne simply because the other drug has zero effect on a lot of people	6	1	-99	1167	correct
755	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	98	4	1	1	25	2	I feel as though alcetyne would be the safer option to choose, as the success rate varies very little when it comes to blood composition, and although there is only a 10% survival rate with either of the medicines, surely it makes sense to go with the option that is more reliable. zyphranol sounds too risky.	6	1	There is a typo on the scenario screen. 'medicines' is spelt as  mediciens .	609	correct
756	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	42	76	1	1	44	2	The Z drug is at least very useful for some of the people, admittedly it is useless for a high number of the population but with an average success rate of 10% for everyone I thought it would be better to check the blood type of patients and largely save those with the corresponding blood type.  The A drug doesn't seem very useful for anyone and it would be more difficult to predict who would be saved.	6	1	-99	505	correct
757	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	54	54	1	1	56	1	It's a difficult decision because on one hand I suppose everyone deserves/expects an equal chance of treatment/recovery but I also think that the money might be best spend on the medicine that has better results even if that is for a smaller group of people overall.	6	1	I noticed medicine was incorrectly spelt as medicien.	471	correct
759	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	36	54	1	1	33	2	I based my decision from the figures provided	6	3	-99	272	incorrect
760	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	62	36	1	1	31	2	If the government orders Z, some people who will receive the early treatment have a much higher probability of death - it is not the government's place to  condemn  these people to death even if it means some others will have a higher chance of survival. Ideally, they should be able to order both and the blood composition of a patient checked in advance of medication to ensure the best chance of survival is provided through treatment.	6	1	No errors noted	429	correct
764	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	90	49	1	1	39	2	The reason I placed more importance on the first option is because not much is said about it, i feel like I understand what the advantages and disadvantages are for the second option but not for the first, so its kind of like picking a wild card and hoping for the best because the other option is less viable.	6	1	-99	617	correct
766	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	0	1	1	32	2	It can be used on any patient - which is surely vital when there is a need to recieve treatment quickly. It also doesn't discriminate toward any particular blood type.	6	1	-99	168	correct
768	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	73	41	1	1	23	2	To my understanding, it would seem as though Alcetryne has the better chance of helping the most people in the fairest way whereas Zyphranol while as effective on average can be much less effective in many people. Therefore, it's  fairer  to get Alcetyne.	6	1	-99	443	correct
771	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	100	1	1	39	2	Both work as treatments. One would be good for targetted treatment and one would be good for general for others who could not appropraitely be treated with the other.	6	1	medicine was spelled incorrectly in the description of the medicines efficacy. Also the sentence which first gave the names of the two medicines used a comma where it should have been a colon. It made the name of the disease and the name of the medicines look like they were in a list together.	473	correct
775	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	63	1	1	32	2	I feel that should A be administered as it gives everyone a fighting chance however I was hard to say that Z shouldn't be as it would still save lives however it is discriminant on blood composition.	6	1	-99	496	correct
778	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	5	82	1	1	42	1	I chose  Zyphranol because I felt this is the drug I'd want if I were a patient. 10% isn't a great chance of survival; the chances are you will die. However, with Zyphranol, if you are lucky enough to have a compatible blood type, you might just have a significantly higher chance of survival. With only an average of a 10% survival rate with the other drug it felt an easy decision to make.	6	1	There were a few spelling mistakes. I think the word 'medicine' was spelled incorrectly once or maybe more.	884	correct
781	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	81	41	1	1	23	2	I went with the medicine that was consistent in the results. Despite, the other being more effective in some people, the results aren't consistent	6	3	-99	150	incorrect
782	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	33	86	1	1	25	1	I gave these ratings because I felt like the drug that gave a 10% chance is everyone wont save many people, since 10% survive is still very low. But the other drug will have a much higher chance of saving people with the correct blood type. I think this will end up saving more lives as a result	6	1	worked well	333	correct
784	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	35	72	1	1	33	2	I believe the Zarapholy medicine had a better average rate of survival overall and can be more used effectively due to knowing it works on certain blood groups. So those with particular blood groups can be treated accordingly.	6	1	-99	296	correct
785	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	99	3	1	1	68	1	Both gave a 10% chance of survival but A is fairer to all people suffering from L whereas Z is pot luck depending on blood group. The govt should go for A initially and then find a way of sourcing Z for specific blood groups.	6	1	There were just a couple of spelling errors, from memory the word 'medicines' was incorrect. Everything else fine.	475	correct
787	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	77	16	1	1	49	2	The issue that I see is that the Zyphranol drug gives false hope to so many people whereby it is only effective for a smaller percentage in real terms.  It's like being given a bullet in russian roulette.  I realise that the survival rate for Alcetyne is only 10% but that is consistent and people would be aware of this beforehand. Imagine being told that if you take Zyphranol you might have an 80% chance of survival - everyone would go for that and ultimately that might only be 2 or 3 people making the probability for survival even lower.	6	1	I didn't notice any errors	450	correct
789	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	72	19	1	1	19	1	I think that from a medical point of view there is little to distinguish between these two treatments. However, I think looking at it politically, purchasing a drug that you know will have a 0% chance of working on 90% of people would be political suicide. Therefore, for the sake of the media and the general public, I would order the Acetyne.	6	1	-99	389	correct
790	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	93	11	1	1	44	1	While there were a greater number of people saved with the Zeph (Don't remember the exact name) brand, it's only for a certain demographic based on blood composition.  The remainder of those who are not assisted and have the  bad  blood composition, will be relatively un-helped by the medicine.  The other Ac (Also don't remember the exact name) brand medicine at least /always/ helps around 10% of the people, so a greater number of people might be saved overall.	6	1	No errors encountered	352	correct
793	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	83	38	1	1	38	1	At first I thought the medicine that varied wildly would be ultimately better because ten percent is already very low odds of survival, so it might be worth it to have the extra boost for some people.  When I saw the graph, I noticed that the varying medicine dropped down to at or near zero percent most of the time, which is definitely not ideal for the average person.  I don't recall the text saying that we know what type of blood a person has, so without this information it is too much of a gamble for each individual person to make.	6	1	-99	403	correct
794	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	16	86	1	1	30	2	If the government orders Alcetyne, then I feel that we are essentially sentencing 90% of the population to death. Given Zyphranol's impressive efficacy in people with certain blood compositions, I think it has a higher likelihood of saving more lives.	6	1	I noticed no errors	344	correct
796	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	21	70	1	1	69	1	Well they both provide 10% cover overall, so on that basis there is no difference. I have a 66% bias though for the one that saves up to 90% of people in certain groups, though it was a hard decision. 10% of everybody is a very small amount, surely even if it's only luck, the response should be to save as many people as possible. Obviously of course I'd hope I was in a group where 90% of people were saved.	6	1	none that I noticed, but I was concentrating on the questions.	534	correct
798	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	39	63	1	1	33	1	While Alcetyne is more consistent in terms of saving people, it has such a low chance of saving people. Zyphranol is extremely effective to certain people and for that reason we should go with a more guaranteed cure until a possible new option is available.	6	1	-99	645	correct
801	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	0	1	1	37	1	Personally I believe that in this situation where all information is known, that all people should have some chance of survival if possible.	6	1	-99	297	correct
804	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	8	1	1	29	2	Alcetyne makes the most sense for a population of people with differing blood types. With Zyphranol, a large number of people will be taking a tablet that does absolutely nothing to prevent them dying, which is a waste of money for the government and not effective treatment for the patients.	6	1	None	212	correct
805	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	100	0	1	1	38	1	The Z drug definitely benefits a few people far more than the A drug, however it condemns most people to ineffective treatment and death. In an ideal world the government should order both and, through testing, give the Z drug to those with the specific blood groups that benefit from it whilst giving the A drug to everyone else. In the presented scenario, it seems more fair to buy the A drug.	6	1	-99	296	correct
806	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	90	8	1	1	45	2	The drug where only the people with a certain blood type may be cured is very discriminatory.  Only about 9 of the blood types have a chance, for the majority of the rest it is down to zero, there is a much better chance with the other drug and I think it's much fairer on the population if everyone has a fair chance of being cured.	6	1	-99	500	correct
808	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	24	63	1	1	22	1	The higher potential of the blue medicine makes it a better option in my opinion.	6	1	-99	212	correct

815	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	68	34	1	1	26	2	While both medicines save patients at the same rate (10%), the variability between patients receiving Z means that there is not an equal chance between individuals. I believe that in medicine, everyone should have access to the same types of treatment which is why A is better in my eyes. If it was possible to do a blood test beforehand to find out the patients blood composition, then I feel like both A and Z should be ordered in equal quantities.	6	1	No errors.	512	correct
816	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	75	34	1	1	39	1	Over time, they're both going to save 10% however I believe that being fair to all would be to use the one with the stable average	6	1	-99	352	correct

832	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	60	38	1	1	38	2	I doesn't really matter which they order unless doctors also have a way to identify the composition of a patients blood in time to choose which treatment they use, but for some reason my intuition said the medicine with more consistent results is better.	6	1	-99	249	correct
835	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	18	83	1	1	57	2	As zyphranole only is varying in blood groups it seems the better choice to be more effective where as the other has no reasoning to why it is a better choice snd the fact that this is based on blood groups gives less chance of early treatment where the other at least has an advantage not being tied to specific bloods.	6	2	-99	502	incorrect

844	1	ten	government	Zyphranol	blue	71	25	1	1	39	1	I chose A above Z because, even though they are equally effective on average, Z is pretty much completely ineffective on the majority of blood types whereas A is more effective across all blood types.

Based on just those numbers alone, I would rather take the more consistent medication.   The one thing you don't factor into this though is that most doctors, unless it is an urgent situation, would test your blood and would tell you,  Based on bloodwork testing, we are of the opinion that taking Z(drug name) would have a higher efficacy rating for your blood type   Otherwise they would likely just give you the A(drug name).      In my own experience, I was taking a drug with known side effects (ulipristal acetate), where I had to undergo monthly liver testing. Because 5 people died in Europe from taking that medication (over a few years) It was pulled from the market in the USA and Canada.  Millions of people benefited from this medication and when it was properly used, it improved the lives of those people. I know it improved mine and allowed me to function.

I would be more inclined to take the medication that works best across all blood variants for a few reasons; it's more likely to give me SOME chance at fighting the disease rather than the potential to have barely any effect. I personally have  bad luck  when it comes to health and the worst scenario generally occurs- I would be more comforted knowing I have atleast a little bit of an immunity boost. I don't know the rarity of the blood composition that agrees best with the Z medication, maybe the blood composition that gives highest chance of immunity.

I would on the whole rather take a chance that I am in one of the blood groups in which it works better as if I am I have a better overall chance of surviving. I am not 100% about this though, because there is also a 50:50 chance that I am not in one of the blood groups and have a virtually zero chance of surviving.

829	2	ten	personal	Zyphranol	blue	16	78	1	1	44	1	In making my decision, I tried to place myself in the situation of having this terminal disease and considered the available facts as they were presented. Firstly, the two treatments available both have a very low recovery rate - 10% - so there is a 90% chance (in my mind, almost certainty) of death. Taking Alcetyne gives, on average, a very low chance of survival but a low chance that is certain. Turning to Zyphranol, out of 40 blood type compositions, 6 of those have a much greater chance of the drug preventing death, on average 15%. I would prefer to take my chances that my blood type was in one of these 6 types, and the further (greater - > 25%) chance that I would recover, than take the drug which saves 1 in 10 people and hope that I was lucky!	6	1	No errors or problems to report, everything worked well for me.	558	correct

Whereas, with the other one, you only have a 10% chance, no matter what blood type you are. So it seems the better choice to me.
